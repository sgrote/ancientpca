\title{VCF file to genotype matrix}
\usage{
vcfToGenotypeMatrix(vcf_file, max_missing_snp = 1,
  max_missing_sample = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_file}{VCF file with genotypes only (i.e. 0/0, 0/1, etc.). Missing values can be coded as "." or "./."}

\item{max_missing_snp}{Set a max. percentage of missingness per SNP allowed. Default is set to 1 (i.e. 100 percent)}

\item{max_missing_sample}{Set a max. percentage of missingness per sample allowed.  Default is set to 1 (i.e. 100 percent)}
}
\value{
matrix (sample x snp) coded 0,1,2, or NA
}
\description{
Load vcf file into R and extract a genotype matrix (sample X SNP) coded with 0,1,2. If samples or SNPs are removed due to too high missingness, non-variance columns are automatically removed.
}
